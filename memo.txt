# System limits

maximum number of ticks in a level
- can be configure of a per-level basis
- the timeout of the level
- the level is considered failed

maximum number of instructions executed in a tick per robot
- 250
- if over this limit the robot is halt for the rest of the level

maximum number of layer of the call stack
- 250
- if over this limit the robot is halt for the rest of the level

maximum number of procedures
- 50 including the main procedure

maximum number of instruction block in a procedure
- 250 instructions

maximum number of conditions in a condition block
- 10 conditions


improvements

unify program and subprogram
- remove the difference between program and subprogram
- they are now call procedure
- procedure are named in numbers starting from 0 to a given limit
- the procedure with number 0 is also called the main procedure
- the callsub instruction can not call the main procedure


save & load program

the player can save a procedure to a slot, and load it to another slot

# the algorithm for pick up

IF
  the hand is empty AND
  the table is a ingredient, container or a counter THEN
    pick up that item from the table
ELSE IF
  the hand is holding an empty container AND
  the table has a non-empty container AND
  the item of the table's container can be put onto the hand's container (R) AND
  the item of the table's container can be pick up (R) THEN
    pick up the item from the table's container
    put that item into the hand's container
ELSE IF
  the hand is holding a non-empty container AND
  the table has a non-empty container AND
  the item of the table's container can be put onto the hand's container (R) AND
  the item of the table's container can be pick up (R) AND
  two items can be combine together (R) THEN
    pick up the item from the table's container
    combine that with the item inside the hand's container
    put the resulting item back to the hand's container
ELSE
  error
